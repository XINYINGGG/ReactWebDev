# Exam 3 Questions

* Answers should be roughly 2-5 sentences, and in your own words.  
* Some questions ask for a code sample - keep them short and to the point.
* Be sure to be clear - be careful not to use vague pronouns like "it" if I can't be completely sure what "it" is.
* I cannot assume knowledge you don't demonstrate, so be clear and explicit.

* NOTE: Because there is no coding portion to Exam 3, each of these questions is worth more to your grade than the questions on previous Exams!  Be sure to have answers you are confident shows your understanding!

## Q: I have said that React JSX components are like functions and follow many of the same best practices.  Give at least 2 such best practices that are good for both JS functions and JSX Components.  (Be substantive!)
	1) Rendering a Component: Sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
	2) The constructor for react components. Through the constructor, we can call super() function and initialize a local state: this.state. You need to bind the function, otherwise use componentDidMount() instead of.
## Q: I have said that using Progressive Enhancement (supporting both MPA and SPA) is best, but many places don't do so because of the effort involved.  What is at least one major reason not to use SPA alone?
	Security problem - hands tied: Automated security scans can have difficulty discovering links when your entire page is built dynamically by a SPA framework. 
	
## Q: Using class-based components and function-based components is largely a matter of preference.  However, (excluding the recent "hooks" addition to React), there are 2 things class-based components give you that function-based components do not.  What are those 2 things? 
	State and syntax method

## Q: The "proxy" setting in your package.json is required for the create-react-app dev server to call a local service, but not if you are calling a service that will always be on a different domain (such as jsonstore.io).  Explain what happens (in terms of network traffic) when your dev server is running on localhost port 3000 and makes a call to `/service` when you have "proxy" set to `http://localhost:4000` and a server running on localhost port 4000 that has the `/service` service.  
	(1) This way, when you fetch('/api/todos') in development, the development server will recognize that itâ€™s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to http://localhost:4000/api/todos as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without text/html in its Accept header to the proxy.
	(2) Conveniently, this avoids CORS issues and error messages 
## Q: Follow-up: Using the above scenario, explain what the network calls are like after you run `npm run build` and are only running all of your content on localhost port 4000 when your JSX makes a call to `/service`
	 The network's request URL is local host 4000 and make no connection with port 3000
## Q: Additional follow-up: Using the above scenario, explain what changes you would make to your JSX if you were putting your JSX and server on a host on a site such as `http://favorite-cats-with-hats.com` (Not a real site)
    change the local host port to the exact site
## Q: I have said that you can only pass data "down" in React, not "up".  What does that mean 
	Props are only through from top to bottom in React's component tree. There is no way to let the props up to its parent component.
## Q: Follow-up: If you can't pass data "up", how can anything that is "down" change data?
	As a child component, in order to use the content in parent components. You can make use of these functions by changing the state(setstate) in a parent conponent above. Once the state changed, the state is passed down as props again.
## Q: A component should not set its own state (if it has one) based on props it was passed in.  Why?  What is the problem with setting state based on props?
	the constructor of the component is executed only once, when the component is mounted. It will not get executed when component re-renders. When the parent component is re-rendered it will not destroy and recreate the child component. React will reuse the child component rendered earlier and do not run the constructor.
## Q: Why should you have only a few components that have state?  What is wrong with having many components that have state? 
	When an overabundance of components are connected, it becomes more difficult to figure out what is causing changes to occur in the page. If too many components get connected to the store, components may get updated at different (and incorrect) times.
